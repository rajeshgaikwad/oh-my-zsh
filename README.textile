This is fork of @oh-my-zsh@ feel free to change it


bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!" 

h2. Setup

This is fork of @oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "zsh":http://www.zsh.org/, the minimum recommended version is 4.3.9.

h3. The automatic installer... (do you trust me?)

You can install this via the command line with either `curl` or `wget`.

h4. via `git`

git clone  git@github.com:rajeshgaikwad/oh-my-zsh.git 

h4. via `curl`

@curl -L https://github.com/rajeshgaikwwad/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh@

h2. Useful

the "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty tasty for tips.


h2. Help out!

I'm far from being a zsh-expert and suspect there are many ways to improve. If you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!



Thank you so much!
